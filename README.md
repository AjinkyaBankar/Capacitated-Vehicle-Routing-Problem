# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

In this project, I tackle the classical operations research problem known as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The goal is to design optimal delivery routes and assign vehicles to them in order to minimize the total distance traveled. To accomplish this task, I employ the PYOMO framework, a powerful optimization modeling tool, along with the open-source GLPK solver. 
The objective function and constraints details can be found here: https://how-to.aimms.com/Articles/332/332-Formulation-CVRP.html
